Radioactive decay is a fundamental nuclear process in which individual decay events occur randomly, while large collections of nuclei exhibit predictable statistical behaviour. This project explores that contrast by modelling radioactive decay using a Monte Carlo approach. By simulating individual decay events over time, the program reproduces the characteristic exponential decrease in the number of undecayed nuclei and illustrates how macroscopic decay laws emerge from microscopic randomness.

The simulation tracks the decay of an initial population of nuclei using probabilistic sampling at each time step and compares the numerical results with theoretical expectations. Statistical fluctuations are naturally observed in the simulated decay curve and diminish as the system size increases. The half-life extracted from the simulation agrees well with the expected value, demonstrating the effectiveness of Monte Carlo methods in modelling stochastic physical processes relevant to nuclear and particle physics.
